# Aircraft Hangar Management System

This repository contains the source code for an Airplane Hangar Management System, a web application that allows users to manage hangars, aircraft, reservations, and generate reports. The system is built using PHP and MySQLi for database interaction.

**Features**

- User Registration: New users can register with a unique username, password, and email. The system ensures that the username is not already taken.

- User Login: Registered users can log in using their credentials. Passwords are securely hashed and stored in the database.

- Dashboard: After logging in, users are presented with a dashboard that provides an overview of their hangars, aircraft, and reservations.

- Hangar Management: Users can create new hangars, edit existing ones, and delete hangars they own. Hangars are associated with specific users to manage access permissions.

- Aircraft Management: Users can add new aircraft, edit their details, and delete aircraft. Aircraft are associated with specific hangars to facilitate organization.

- Reservation Management: Users can create reservations for specific hangars and aircraft, view their reservations, and cancel existing reservations. The system ensures that reservations do not overlap.

- Reports Generation: Users can generate reports for a specific hangar, showing its reservations in a tabular format.

Thank you for using the Airplane Hangar Management System!
